# Cardiovascular-Risk-Assesment
This study presents a novel method for predicting cardiac disease by integrating a 2D CNN with an MTCNN for accurate face feature detection and alignment in medical images. By harnessing deep learning's ability to extract features, our framework offers a non-invasive, effective approach to early cardiovascular diagnosis and intervention.
