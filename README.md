# Cardiovascular-Risk-Assesment
PROPOSED SYSTEM:
In proposed system, the input image is taken from dataset repository. In pre-processing, we can resize the original image and gray scale conversion. After that, we can extract the features from pre-processed image such as Mean Median Variance. We can split the images into test image and train image. Then, we can implement the different deep learning algorithms such as MTCNN and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the input image is affected or not. Finally, the system can estimate some performance metrics such as accuracy and error rate. The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing accuracy improvement. 
ADVANTAGES:
•	It is efficient for large number of datasets.
•	The experimental result is high when compared with existing system.
•	Time consumption is low.
•	It improve the achieved in feature stability
